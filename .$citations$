  abstract = {A tunable Kondo effect has been realized in small quantum dots. A
	dot can be switched from a Kondo system to a non-Kondo system as
	the number of electrons on the dot is changed from odd to even. The
	Kondo temperature can be tuned by means of a gate voltage as a single-particle
	energy state nears the Fermi energy. Measurements of the temperature
	and magnetic field dependence of a Coulomb-blockaded dot show good
	agreement with predictions of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium
	Kondo effects.},

  abstract = {Molecules of benzene-1,4-dithiol were self-assembled onto the two
	facing gold electrodes of a mechanically controllable break junction
	to form a statically stable gold-sulfur-aryl-sulfur-gold system,
	allowing for direct observation of charge transport through the molecules.
	Current-voltage measurements at room temperature demonstrated a highly
	reproducible apparent gap at about 0.7 volt, and the conductance-voltage
	curve showed two steps in both bias directions. This study provides
	a quantative measure of the conductance of a junction containing
	a single molecule, which is a fundamental step in the emerging area
	of molecular-scale electronics.},
