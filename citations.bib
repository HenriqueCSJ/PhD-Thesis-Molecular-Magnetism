  abstract = {A novel three-terminal switching device, fabricated only from metals,
	has recently been demonstrated. Somewhat similar to a semiconductor
	transistor, the physical principles of operation are quite different.
	It is an active device driven by a thermodynamic force associated
	with the effective Zeeman energy of the spin polarized electrons
	in the base. `Bipolar' has a double meaning: there are two polarities
	of carriers, upspin and downspin electrons; and the output can be
	a positive or negative voltage (or current). The three-terminal device
	does not have power gain, but because it shows a memory effect it
	is natural to use it as a storage element in a nonvolatile memory
	array. Power gain can be achieved in a five-terminal embodiment,
	allowing fanout and the linking of devices in logic operations. Switching
	times faster than 1 ns can be expected. Because all the layers are
	metals and charge carrier densities are high, fabrication of the
	device at submicron scales is quite possible and operation at the
	nanometer scale is conceivable. Thus, the possibility of achieving
	high packing densities is very plausible, and is not obviated by
	problems common to semiconductors such as heat dissipation and low
	carrier density.},
