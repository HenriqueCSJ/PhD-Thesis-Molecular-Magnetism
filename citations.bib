  abstract = {Using high-frequency EPR spectroscopy we have found that a cluster
	comprising eight iron(III) ions, Fe 8 , which is essentially flat,
	has a ground S = 10 state and an Ising-type anisotropy. For the first
	time both ac susceptibility and MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy could be
	used in order to monitor the relaxation time of the magnetization,
	which was found to follow a thermally activated behavior, as in a
	superparamagnet, with Ï 0 = 1.9 Ã 10 â7 s and an energy barrier
	of 22.2 K. The set of data allowed us to conclude that the origin
	of the anisotropy in nanosize molecular clusters is associated with
	the single ion contributions and not with the shape of the clusters.},

	of the two novel disciplines of spintronics and molecular electronics.
	A fundamental link between these two fields can be established using
	molecular magnetic materials and, in particular, single-molecule
	magnets. Here, we review the first progress in the resulting field,
	molecular spintronics, which will enable the manipulation of spin
	and charges in electronic devices containing one or more molecules.
	We discuss the advantages over more conventional materials, and the
	potential applications in information storage and processing. We
	also outline current challenges in the field, and propose convenient
	schemes to overcome them.},

  abstract = {An experimental method based on the Landau-Zener model was developed
	to measure very small tunnel splittings in molecular clusters of
	eight iron atoms, which at low temperature behave like a nanomagnet
	with a spin ground state of S = 10. The observed oscillations of
	the tunnel splittings as a function of the magnetic field applied
	along the hard anisotropy axis are due to topological quantum interference
	of two tunnel paths of opposite windings. Transitions between quantum
	numbers M = âSand (S â n), with n even or odd, revealed a parity
	effect that is analogous to the suppression of tunneling predicted
	for half-integer spins. This observation is direct evidence of the
	topological part of the quantum spin phase (Berry phase) in a magnetic
	system.},
