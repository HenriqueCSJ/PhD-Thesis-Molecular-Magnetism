  abstract = {This paper provides an overview on the current understanding of electromigration
	in metals. The discussion is first focused on studies in bulk metals
	and alloys. This part includes a thermodynamic formulation of electromigration,
	a kinetic analysis of the atomic processes and a review of the theory.
	In addition, experimental results in interstitial and substitutional
	systems are summarised. The second part of the paper reviews the
	studies in metallic thin films. This emerged as an important area
	of electromigration studies since the late 1960s when electromigration
	damage was found to cause failure of conductor lines in integrated
	circuits. The discussion will review first the basic nature of electromigration
	in thin films with emphasis on the role of grain boundaries in mass
	transport and damage formation. Then the materials issues of electromigration
	will be explored according to the scaling trends in VLSI technology.
	Finally, the recent results of electromigration in fine lines and
	device contacts of dimensions in the micrometre range are discussed.},

  abstract = {A novel three-terminal switching device, fabricated only from metals,
	has recently been demonstrated. Somewhat similar to a semiconductor
	transistor, the physical principles of operation are quite different.
	It is an active device driven by a thermodynamic force associated
	with the effective Zeeman energy of the spin polarized electrons
	in the base. `Bipolar' has a double meaning: there are two polarities
	of carriers, upspin and downspin electrons; and the output can be
	a positive or negative voltage (or current). The three-terminal device
	does not have power gain, but because it shows a memory effect it
	is natural to use it as a storage element in a nonvolatile memory
	array. Power gain can be achieved in a five-terminal embodiment,
	allowing fanout and the linking of devices in logic operations. Switching
	times faster than 1 ns can be expected. Because all the layers are
	metals and charge carrier densities are high, fabrication of the
	device at submicron scales is quite possible and operation at the
	nanometer scale is conceivable. Thus, the possibility of achieving
	high packing densities is very plausible, and is not obviated by
	problems common to semiconductors such as heat dissipation and low
	carrier density.},

Current-voltage measurements at room temperature demonstrated a highly reproducible apparent gap at about 0.7 volt, and the conductance-voltage curve showed two steps in both bias directions. This study provides a quantative measure of the conductance of a junction containing a single molecule, which is a fundamental step in the emerging area of molecular-scale electronics.}

	At present, the most popular technique to fabricate three-terminal
	molecular devices makes use of electromigration. Although it is a
	statistical process, we show that control over the gap resistance
	can be obtained. A detailed analysis of the current-voltage characteristics
	of gaps without molecules, however, shows that they reveal features
	that can mistakenly be attributed to molecular transport. This observation
	raises questions about which gaps with molecules can be disregarded
	and which not. We show that electrical characteristics can be controlled
	by the rational design of the molecular bridge and that vibrational
	modes probed by electrical transport are of potential interest as
	molecular fingerprints.},
