  abstract = {Using high-frequency EPR spectroscopy we have found that a cluster
	comprising eight iron(III) ions, Fe 8 , which is essentially flat,
	has a ground S = 10 state and an Ising-type anisotropy. For the first
	time both ac susceptibility and MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy could be
	used in order to monitor the relaxation time of the magnetization,
	which was found to follow a thermally activated behavior, as in a
	superparamagnet, with Ï 0 = 1.9 Ã 10 â7 s and an energy barrier
	of 22.2 K. The set of data allowed us to conclude that the origin
	of the anisotropy in nanosize molecular clusters is associated with
	the single ion contributions and not with the shape of the clusters.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview on the current understanding of electromigration
	in metals. The discussion is first focused on studies in bulk metals
	and alloys. This part includes a thermodynamic formulation of electromigration,
	a kinetic analysis of the atomic processes and a review of the theory.
	In addition, experimental results in interstitial and substitutional
	systems are summarised. The second part of the paper reviews the
	studies in metallic thin films. This emerged as an important area
	of electromigration studies since the late 1960s when electromigration
	damage was found to cause failure of conductor lines in integrated
	circuits. The discussion will review first the basic nature of electromigration
	in thin films with emphasis on the role of grain boundaries in mass
	transport and damage formation. Then the materials issues of electromigration
	will be explored according to the scaling trends in VLSI technology.
	Finally, the recent results of electromigration in fine lines and
	device contacts of dimensions in the micrometre range are discussed.},

  abstract = {A novel three-terminal switching device, fabricated only from metals,
	has recently been demonstrated. Somewhat similar to a semiconductor
	transistor, the physical principles of operation are quite different.
	It is an active device driven by a thermodynamic force associated
	with the effective Zeeman energy of the spin polarized electrons
	in the base. `Bipolar' has a double meaning: there are two polarities
	of carriers, upspin and downspin electrons; and the output can be
	a positive or negative voltage (or current). The three-terminal device
	does not have power gain, but because it shows a memory effect it
	is natural to use it as a storage element in a nonvolatile memory
	array. Power gain can be achieved in a five-terminal embodiment,
	allowing fanout and the linking of devices in logic operations. Switching
	times faster than 1 ns can be expected. Because all the layers are
	metals and charge carrier densities are high, fabrication of the
	device at submicron scales is quite possible and operation at the
	nanometer scale is conceivable. Thus, the possibility of achieving
	high packing densities is very plausible, and is not obviated by
	problems common to semiconductors such as heat dissipation and low
	carrier density.},

  abstract = {The electron spin made its debut in the device world only two decades
	ago but today our ability of detecting the spin state of a moving
	electron underpins the entire magnetic data storage industry. This
	technological revolution has been driven by a constant improvement
	in our understanding on how spins can be injected, manipulated and
	detected in the solid state, a field which is collectively named
	Spintronics. Recently a number of pioneering experiments and theoretical
	works suggest that organic materials can offer similar and perhaps
	superior performances in making spin-devices than the more conventional
	inorganic metals and semiconductors. Furthermore they can pave the
	way for radically new device concepts. This is Molecular Spintronics,
	a blossoming research area aimed at exploring how the unique properties
	of the organic world can marry the requirements of spin-devices.
	Importantly, after a first phase, where most of the research was
	focussed on exporting the concepts of inorganic spintronics to organic
	materials, the field has moved to a more mature age, where the exploitation
	of the unique properties of molecules has begun to emerge. Molecular
	spintronics now collects a diverse and interdisciplinary community
	ranging from device physicists to synthetic chemists to surface scientists.
	In this critical review, I will survey this fascinating, rapidly
	evolving, field with a particular eye on new directions and opportunities.
	The main differences and challenges with respect to standard spintronics
	will be discussed and so will be the potential cross-fertilization
	with other fields (177 references).},

	the discovery that slow relaxation of the magnetization at liquid
	nitrogen temperature can occur in mononuclear complexes of these

	of the relation of the crystal field parameters, which determine
	the anisotropy of these systems and consequently their interesting
	magnetic properties, with the geometry of the coordination sphere
	around the lanthanide centre and with the pattern of f orbitals.
	The problem of systems of low point symmetry is also addressed by
	showing how detailed single crystal investigation, coupled to more
	sophisticated calculation procedures, is an absolute necessity to
	obtain meaningful structure-property relationships in these systems.},

  abstract = {Cet article décrit un nouvel opérateur de détection de rupture dans
	un signal très bruité. Cet opérateur s'appuie sur les propriétés
	de stationnarité locale du signal. Il est basé sur l'estimation de
	la variance de son moment d'ordre 1 glissant. Il s'agit d'un filtre
	non linéaire qui fournit en sortie une valeur proche de zéro dans
	le cas stationnaire et une réponse de forte amplitude en présence
	de rupture. Son comportement s'apparente, d'une certaine façon, à
	celui de l'opérateur de Canny-Deriche auquel il est systématiquement
	comparé pour des signaux, bruités ou non, comportant une rupture.
	La comparaison s'avère à l'avantage de ce nouvel opérateur.},

  abstract = {Incorporation of a third, gate electrode in the device geometry of
	molecular junctions is necessary to identify the transport mechanism.
	At present, the most popular technique to fabricate three-terminal
	molecular devices makes use of electromigration. Although it is a
	statistical process, we show that control over the gap resistance
	can be obtained. A detailed analysis of the current-voltage characteristics
	of gaps without molecules, however, shows that they reveal features
	that can mistakenly be attributed to molecular transport. This observation
	raises questions about which gaps with molecules can be disregarded
	and which not. We show that electrical characteristics can be controlled
	by the rational design of the molecular bridge and that vibrational
	modes probed by electrical transport are of potential interest as
	molecular fingerprints.},
